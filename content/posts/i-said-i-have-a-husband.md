I said, I Have a husband...
and a boyfriend.

Basically it happens so that I fallen in love with him, as so he did with me.
I want to tell the story of when we met, however, the story of how it happened and what makes it possible is out of course for this post.

Just wanted to say thank you S. 
Thanks for opening up my heart to love those who really matter
