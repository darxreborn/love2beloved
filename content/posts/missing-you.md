This is a post about missing you,

I exploded in motion, this time I went all the way through, just because I miss you.

I feel like bumping; I feel like the miss and need for you. I don't write these words any often, and I don't think them through.
This story startsa few months ago, that's when I met him. We will call him Denis, yeah the name is in russian.
It started as a feel inside, like a binding uniting the both of us; hilariously this outgrew everything I would have ever thought being possible on my side.
It actually happened very randomly, I will be writing about it later on in the future in other articles. Right now my purpose is just to outspeak what i felt and feel at this very right minute. SOmetimes feelings have bulletpoints related to past experiences, and this is a story including exactly this, be warned and ready, it will happen again as its my way to express myself.

My birthday went through on the 6th of Novemeber, the day was lived rather weirdly; had a breakup with my husband...
yeah, I have a husband and a boyfriend.

I never thought I can fall into such a basic human thing as in love; seems like last time I felt it as I can remember was 10 years ago.

I know, I told nothing in here, but that will be the start of George (me) opening up to self and the world.
One Day I will outburst the full story of mine.

Cheers!
