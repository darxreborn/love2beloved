I'm going through harsh moments in life, at the end of the day, my experience brought me by my own actions driven by actions made by my own decisions.

So. Hate is irrational, it doesn't have a goal, it doesn't reward a profitable achievement if not commited for it.
S. considers that the world has to adapt to his reality or/& perception because he refuses to conceive a point of view or opinion of the people surrounding him (he only does it if the target/individual is valuable or matters closely to him)
In the menawhile, the full world is sppining.
The people surrounding him, may or/and may not - adapt in the attempt to co-exist and convive in harmony with each other. But, should they proceed that way?

Clarity, is up to your mind. Your decision is your own.
Nobody really wishes to step over the other, that's too miserable.

Take Care!
