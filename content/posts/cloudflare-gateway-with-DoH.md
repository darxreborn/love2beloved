This is as far as I went with our configuration, but you can go a step further by installing and trusting Cloudflare's certificates. This would allow you to deploy a proxy service and enable A/V scanning, HTTP filtering, browser isolation, and more. This seemed too intrusive for what we needed in our household, but it's nice knowing it's an option and something I might try later in a lab environment (expect a post if I do).
